## Changelog
### 7.5.1

This release removes the `user_id` and the `transaction` field from the dynamic sampling context data that is attached to outgoing requests as well as sent to Relay.

- ref(tracing): Remove transaction name and user_id from DSC ([#5363](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5363))

### 7.5.0

This release adds the `sendDefaultPii` flag to the `Sentry.init` options.
When using performance monitoring capabilities of the SDK, it controls whether user IDs (set via `Sentry.setUser`) are propagated in the `baggage` header of outgoing HTTP requests.
This flag is set to `false` per default, and acts as an opt-in mechanism for sending potentially sensitive data.
If you want to attach user IDs to Sentry transactions and traces, set this flag to `true` but keep in mind that this is potentially sensitive information.

- feat(sdk): Add sendDefaultPii option to the JS SDKs ([#5341](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5341))
- fix(remix): Sourcemaps upload script is missing in the tarball ([#5356](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5356))
- fix(remix): Use cjs for main entry point ([#5352](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5352))
- ref(tracing): Only add `user_id` to DSC if `sendDefaultPii` is `true` ([#5344](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5344))

Work in this release contributed by jkcorrea and nfelger. Thank you for your contributions!

### 7.4.1

This release includes the first *published* version of `sentry/remix`.

- build(remix): Make remix package public ([#5349](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5349))
