### Breaking Changes

Updater and Danger reusable workflows are now composite actions ([#114](https://github.com/getsentry/github-workflows/pull/114))

To update your existing Updater workflows:
```yaml
### Before
  native:
    uses: getsentry/github-workflows/.github/workflows/updater.yml@v2
    with:
      path: scripts/update-sentry-native-ndk.sh
      name: Native SDK
    secrets:
      # If a custom token is used instead, a CI would be triggered on a created PR.
      api-token: ${{ secrets.CI_DEPLOY_KEY }}

### After
  native:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: getsentry/github-workflows/updater@v3
        with:
          path: scripts/update-sentry-native-ndk.sh
          name: Native SDK
          api-token: ${{ secrets.CI_DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

To update your existing Danger workflows:
```yaml
### Before
  danger:
    uses: getsentry/github-workflows/.github/workflows/danger.yml@v2

### After
  danger:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: getsentry/github-workflows/danger@v3
```
